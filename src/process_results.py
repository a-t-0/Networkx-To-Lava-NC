    """Takes in the orignal graph and mdsa, along with the brain adaptation and
    radiation damaged graphs (if they exist). Then computes which nodes the
    Alipour algorithm selects and compares that node selection with the node
    selection generated by the mdsa-, brain-adaptation- and radiation-damaged
    graphs respectively. Returns two lists, one with the lists for node
    selections, and another with the 3 boolean pass/fail values per SNN. The
    first list contains up to 4 lists of selected nodes for: the
    Alipour algorithm and the mdsa-, brain-adaptation- and radiation-damaged
     SNN graphs respectively. The second list contains 3 booleans for the
     mdsa-, brain-adaptation- and radiation-damaged SNN graphs respectively."""
